# ImageTransparentManagement
 Image transparent pixel management (using OpenCV)


#Implementation list (Update)

 07.19 2019 (version 1.0)
 - Load file by entering a path into the console
 - import transparent image only. (four channels)
 - Eliminate transparency according to trackbar adjustment values.
 - Conversion image can be saved.


# How to use
 1. Enter the path in the console window.
 ex ) C:\Users\Computer\Desktop\image.png

 2. Move the trackbar to remove all transparency
(If set to 90, all pixels with less than 90 transparency will have zero percent transparency, while the rest will be 100 percent.)

 3. Pressing the 'R' key completes the setup, and pressing S saves the file separately.
